The name "axolotl" comes from the Nahuatl language, where atl means water and xolotl means dog, so they’re sometimes called “water dogs.”
While wild axolotls are usually dark brown or black, captive-bred ones come in a variety of colors, including white (leucistic), albino, golden, and even glow-in-the-dark varieties (due to genetic modification).
Axolotls are known for being super relaxed and non-aggressive. They rarely show any signs of stress and spend most of their time just floating around, looking zen.
